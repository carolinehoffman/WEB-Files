    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <section id="workdivs">
      <div>
        <img src="assets/paint.jpg" alt="a photo using paint bombs"/>
        <p>This photograph was taken just outside of Oxford, England with a Canon camera, while I was studying photography in a pre-college program called Oxbridge.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="assets/drawing.jpg" alt="a drawing of a girl"/>
        <p>I doodled this girl when I was in high school, and I've also liked the looks of her. I'm a big fan of drawing eyes, so I always start with them and go from there.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="assets/flower.jpg" alt="a photo of a flower"/>
        <p>This photograph was taken outside of the La Brea Tar Pits in California. I loved the way it looked, especially with such a dark and eerie edit.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="assets/field.jpg" alt="an edited image of Farrand Field"/>
        <p>This image was edited using Photoshop. I took the photo my freshman year at CU Boulder, and used different features on Photoshop to get it to look this way.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <img src="assets/bird.jpg" alt="a photo of a hummingbird"/>
          <p>This photograph was also taken in California, just off the beach. The hummingbird was sitting so perfectly still. I just had to capture its peaceful essence.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="assets/pattern.jpg" alt="a graphic design using my own drawings"/>
        <p>This pattern was made in Photoshop, but it was created when I was in high school. I used some of my own drawings and edited them around to make a fun pattern.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="assets/ocean.jpg" alt="a photo of the ocean"/>
        <p>This photograph was taken just off the beach in California. The waves crashing against the rock was so cool to look at.</p>
